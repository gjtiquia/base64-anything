## development

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# start development server
pnpm dev

# build for production
pnpm build

# preview production build
pnpm preview
```

## how it works

the app uses the browser's built-in apis to handle file operations:

1. **encoding:** uses `FileReader` to read files and convert them to base64.
2. **decoding:** uses `atob` to decode base64 strings and creates downloadable files.
3. **dark mode:** detects system preference and allows manual toggle.

## side note

this was an excuse to play with cursor + claude 3.7 sonnet thinking modelðŸ˜‚ amazed and had some fun
